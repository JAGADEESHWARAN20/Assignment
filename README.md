## Graphing Application

### Overview
The Graphing Application allows users to drag-and-drop data points onto a canvas to generate various types of graphs. Users can select different graph types and customize axis labels and scales. The application uses React, `react-draggable`, and `react-chartjs-2` for visualization.

### Features
- **Drag-and-Drop Data Points:** Drag data points from a list and drop them onto a canvas.
- **Graph Generation:** Automatically generates graphs based on the dropped data points.
- **Graph Types:** Supports different types of graphs, including line, scatter, and bar.
- **Axis Customization:** Customize axis labels and scales.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/graphing-app.git
cd graphing-app

2. Install Dependencies
Install the required npm packages:

npm install

3. Start the Application
Run the development server to start the application:

npm start

4. Use the Application
Drag-and-Drop Data Points: Drag data points from the data point list and drop them onto the canvas.
Change Graph Type: Select the desired graph type (line, scatter, bar) from the dropdown menu.
Customize Axes: Adjust axis labels and scales as needed.
Testing
Ensure the application works correctly by:

Testing drag-and-drop functionality.
Verifying graph generation for different types of graphs.
Checking axis customization.
